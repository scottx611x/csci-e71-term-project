Product Backlog Ordering Rationale
----------------------------------
The core functions are manipulating the inventory items, so these are the most important to get done if we ran out of time. Searching and reporting are extremely useful add-ons, but depend on the database existing first. Having non-administrator accounts would be a nice addition for a multi-user environment, but could be dispensed with if necessary.

Definition of Ready
-------------------
When a produt backlog item:
 * has a title
 * has an opening sentence
 * has details
 * has been estimated
 * has user acceptance criteria
 
 Definition of Done
-------------------
 * As a user, I should be able to use all features within the IE11 or Edge browsers in cloud
 * has tests
 * Good test coverage

 Relative Size Estimating Activity
 ---------------------------------
 
 All developers, and only developers, participated in relative size estimating. We accomplished this activity by doing a planning poker-like activity over a group video chat session

Sprint 1 Planning
=================
Velocity estimate: 14.3 (Total points / 3 sprints)
